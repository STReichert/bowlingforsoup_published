- Aust tries to tell [[ðŸ™‹ People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] he'll be more like 8:30... but her (assistant?) 
## Chatting and catching up as a group
- We relay the various news
- Ulfgar comes in pulling Derald by the Ear
	- "Look at the familiar face"
	- [[ðŸ™‹ People/Derald\|Derald]]!
		- He is saying that he came down here, he's an orphan and he stumbled into the secret passageway
		- Just looking down the hallways...
		- He's full of shit
			- he was in the tunnels to hide the drugs...
				- That is is smuggling for berrain stonebrow
					- We get his log book
						- The first log is about 4 weeks ago
						- refers to communications with the "captain"
						- some pages in the back have been torn out
							- the captain's notes
					- They've mostly been moving "smank"
						- Aust has heard of smank before
						- It is a stimulant that can be addictive.  A lot like cocaine. Not great for people in the long run.
					- He's been storing them in the secret tunnels.
						- getting them into the secret passageways 
						- The supply is coming up from shady creek run for the Utlots.
							- Unclear what he is doing with it...
							- He is transporting the rest of it on the caravans to Uthodurn.
		- O offers that we could give him a decent job for security... it freaking works
			- He makes about 7 gold a week which eeks out a modest lifestyle
			- O offers him 10 gold a week for the first month and if he does well a raise up to 12 gold a month
				- We want to help him with the accounting 
				- Some task managing
				- Some light spying and making sure that things work well
					- first things first we take down Captain Stonebrow
## What Derald knows about Berrain Stonebrow
- Word that he is here not out of distinguishment
	- This was maybe a slap on the wrist for something.
	- He's dumb and immature
	- Prideful
		- He kinda acts like he's trying to stick it to someone
		- Probably his uncle?
	- Derald had capitalized on the volitile personality
- Trying to publicly humiliate him could backfire
- Things do seem to run... he is more or less doing his job
	- He is just smuggling drugs
- "The Major is a Corsair based in shady creek run..."
	- they've had some back and forth.

Derald has been living in a Yurt by the secret passageway. So we offer him a room in the keep.

## Strategizing for chatting with Stonebrow
- We want to Bro out and seem chummy
- Ulfgar knows the classic dwarven game of keg standing
	- like soccer/basketball but a keg and the goal is to get the keg up onto a high shelf 

## Meeting with Stonebrow
- He comes in and is suspicious of us but doesn't know if it was us that left his room unlocked.
- He's brash
- The guards all are sitting in a circle facing out away from us. 
	- Fucking douche
