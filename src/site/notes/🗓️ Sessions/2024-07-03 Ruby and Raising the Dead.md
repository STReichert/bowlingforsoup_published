## Summary
We fight with the hags, and boy howdy...
	We kill them
	But Aust got killed
	We free Aurelia and the Other captives but they are all very out of it
		Aurelia can cast reincarnate, but neither she (nor Ulfgar) have what we would need to do that.
	O has a moment with aust

</div></div>

The last things Aust remembers is Anabel falling and the claws entering his chest.
O and Faem Meet Ruby
Ruby is their child... well a hag. She looks human but will supposedly turn. Or she was supposed to turn on her 13th birthday. She looks to be about mid to late teans
Ruby was looking for people to kill her and had escaped to try to find people, but 
She will one day turn into a hag, and there will be a sense of base instinct. Hags do feed off of suffering
She doesn't have a lot of hope for when that day comes.

She has a deep pain and/or fear leading to her resoluteness and straightforwardness.
Faem unlocks her and she starts heading upstairs. Faem follows behind and O stays a minute to look at what else is in the cave... There is not much there except hag things (like a doll actually made out of baby... yikes).

O wants to just burry Aust, Ulfgar wants to resurrect...

Ruby recommends that we burn the place down...
	Faem guides people out
	Ulfgar is casting plant growth (over 8 hours!)
We get some people out
	An unconscious elf
	A human in a rough place
	An unconscious gnome

In Molesmyr there was someone who found a magic mace from the betrayers. [[Bane\|Bane]]. It was imbued with the soul of a great fiend. The fiend exerted his will over the adventurer. He sought assistance, looking for a way to break the mace and be rid of it. But he didn't think through the situation. 
	According to the hags, the partially destroyed arm of the betrayers destroyed [[üó∫Ô∏è Places/Ruins of Molaesmyr\|Molaesmyr]] and the hags took that power to create the corruption and gain power.
Ruby doesn't know what they wanted from her specifically.
There seemed to be some philosophical differences between Heddy and the Coven of Hags
	They indicated that she had gone soft.

Aust is going through darkness amidst stars before being tugged back to the training pit
	Faem has a moment meditating and praying to Aust
After casting the plant growth spell the sun comes out and the clouds break. And the plants climb and grow.
	The vines on Ulfgar's armor starts growing buds and leaves. The leather gets tougher, an extra layer of bark. The Armor seems to awaken.
	Ulfgar gets a +2 to AC and some attack bonus, as well as can turn into both an owl and a polar bear for free.
Aurelia can teleport us to the blooming grove through a big oak tree
### The Blooming Grove
We arrive back
	[[üôã People/Caduceus Clay\|Caduceus]] notices that Aurelia is with us and is super distrustful
		She starts to sing a song that he knows and they reunite
Ruby apparently was raised in shady creek run
	She was having some visions that sound bad and tried to run away
We all eat some food
	Ruby started having some weird intrusive thoughts but that became more and more hag centric. In dreams being visited by her mothers, but was denying it. She had some prophetic dreams. Cities on fire. The corruption. Instances of a dark urge.
Mug helps the other captives that are healing. [[üôã People/Siobhan Byrch\|Siobhan]] is still there and we have the ruin from the green hag [[Milicent\|Milicent]]. 
	We go to restore Siobhan by breaking the rune and greater restoration-ing her. 
We can already see the corruption lifting in the woods

Ulfgar, Siobhan, and I take Aust's body back to Uthodurn so Zahara can help us out.
Aust has a moment with Galoin and says "I don't think I'm dont yet"
	Zahara just says "I need more time with you, come back"
