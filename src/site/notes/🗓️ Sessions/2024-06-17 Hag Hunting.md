Where we are:
- In the forest just landed in the hags clearing
- They have a hostage ([[ðŸ™‹ People/Aurelia Clay\|Aurelia Clay]])
- The hag we've seen before (green) - [[Milicent\|Milicent]]
- The blue one - [[Gertrude\|Gertrude]]
	- They are consuming the nightmares of one of their captives
- [[Milicent\|Milicent]] is brewing some nasty concoction with fingernails and entrails
- We don't see anything
## Hag's Hut
We peak in the windows and see a bunch of hostages
Someone invisible sneaked past us around the corner

There are some bramble effigies
- 4 of them.

We hear some voices, Gertrude and [[Anabel\|Anabel]]
	Hi pitched voice from above. Gertrude is above us on the roof of the hut.

## Fighting
It's a tricky fight, they've had a bit of invisibility going
They have lair actions and legendary actions :(
Ulfgar is on the roof with Gertrude
Aust is fighting the big one, Anabel
I have the hilt of the shifting sun which burns the brambles.
