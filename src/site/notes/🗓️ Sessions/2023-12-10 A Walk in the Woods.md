## We head out
- There is something following us and slipping out of view
- I fake trip and O comes to help me
	- O then calls out "hello? Is someone there?"
	- They spot it Camo'd with the tree bark
- O convinces it to reveal itself!
	- Tall gangly figure covered in bark or maybe made out of bark?
	- Humanoid
	- It is a tree fey something
- This creature is speaking sylvan (which none of us do)
	- it grows a little flower
	- Aust insights that it is saying thank you.

## on a night that on the journey
- we make camp before sundown
- There is a weird owl sound during the watch, gravely
	- Then a third and fourth
	- Then a cacophony of owls
	- Noticeably loud
- Ulfgar only hears one Owl
	- But we all hear hundreds of owls
	- Ulfgar casts speak with animals and talks to it
		- It uses the forest to confuse it's prey
		- Ulfgar convices it to quiet the forest, gives it some jerky, and helps it hunt for mice 

## Mid-day, Aust in the lead
- Aust, all of a sudden smells rotting flesh
- About 250 feet away from the bodies, a pile of corpses
- Aust and O approach to plant a flower
	- The copses animate as a bunch of tiny greasy (nibbles like bodies)

O and Faem have a nice moral quandry chat
- Is swatting a fly allowed

## We get close to the Brawny Awl
- There is a fey creature in Ulfgar's pocket that ate all of his jerky
- Its sleepy so ulfgar picks it up gingerly and places it in a little tree
- Later that day another burp and he's back in the pocket
-
