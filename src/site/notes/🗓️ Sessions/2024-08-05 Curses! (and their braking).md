## Previous Session Recap
[[🙋 People/PCs/O\|O]] ran off into the woods and decided not to kill ruby, so they grew really old. (after talking to aust)
Aust killed ruby because the sword made him do it.
## Agenda/To-Do
- [ ] Lift the curse on Aust from this sword (Aust goes to Zahara for help)
- [ ] Faem and Ulfgar go try to catch up with O and get them to come back.
## Summary
### O alone in the woods
They are in the woods alone and remember they still have the mace with them.as they reach a glade. They make a prayer about circles.
Then [[🙋 People/Clarence\|Clarence]] shows up!

Ulfgar and Faem trundle off through the woods in search of O. Ulfgar is leading the way and is ... sniffing... to follow the trail.

Talking to Clarence more O ponders what has led them to where they are and their guilt but also their home sickness. 

Clarence recommends moving energy in a third direction, not home, not just staying in the same place. 
> "Do you follow your beliefs because they are what eldath says is right or because it was what you believe to be right?" - Clarence

O doesn't think their values mean as much to their friends (us) and is maybe resentful
O also feels bad that they bent to the circumstances
Also maybe thinking that there was no particular right or wrong to it at all, and there is no circle.
### Aust trying to break a curse
Aust met up with Zahara and Siobhan at the [[🗺️ Places/Brawny Awl\|Brawny Awl]] to try and break the curse of the sword, and they cast something but it doesn't seem to work out... Aust is still tied to the sword.

Aust's sword is probably an arm of the betrayer gods but we don't know what it necessarily is. We don't necessarily know how to break the curse. 
We spend some time looking and recapping [[📚 In Game Resources & Lore/Where the Corruption Came From (aka Ruby's Bedtime Story)\|Ruby's Bedtime Story]] and that solidifies the possibility that this is an arm of the betrayer gods.

Zahara will need to do some more research and learning. 

While Aust is asleep, he dreams...
	In this dream there is darkness, followed by a familiar voice speaking to him... in the darkness there is a whip wreathed in flames and a sword similar to his own. Two large leathery wings attached to a body and horns on it's head. Plus flame red eyes.
