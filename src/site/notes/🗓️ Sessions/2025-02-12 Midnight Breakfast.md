## Summary
### Brunch
[[ðŸ™‹ People/Elsivar Arorenn\|Elsivar Arorenn]] has gotten some boar
Ulfgar got eggs for a giant omlet.
- Ulfgar envisions a neopets giant omlet vibe
- Also some individually portioned berry tarts
Ulfgar is handing out omlet,
Faem is on tart duty
O is doing Ale
Aust is roasting the meat.

Gottrick handed out flyers in the Brawny awl and took some fliers to uthodurn so a few folks came through.

A whole cast of characters:
- The guards in town, construction workers
- All of the folks in the brawny Awl
[[ðŸ™‹ People/Berrain Stonebrow\|Berrain Stonebrow]] comes in early on his this morning
- Instead of getting in line for the food he walks right up to Ulfgar. 
- He comes up to say thank you on behalf of the guards, and he wanted to see if he could lend a hand... "Maybe handing out the tacky bread is too much for him"
- O comes up and says:
	- I see what ulfgar is saying I'll take the tacky bread and you can pour the ale.
- [[Bethella Gildenedge\|Bethella Gildenedge]] comes in with [[ðŸ™‹ People/Shazarial Bendelthal\|Shaz]] dressed decidely differently from how faem dressed as shaz the day before. They go up to get some ale from Berrain.
	- Berrain breaks his brain trying to figure out what happed, and then said "it's good to see you again after all this time"
	- Berrain seems generally happy that shaz is doing ok, and maybe they have a moment of genuine connection.
Gottrick is running around, making sure that everything is running. Derald is enjoying the brunch more than helping out.

There is a family from uthodurn that seems to be visiting and they have a young son derald's age, so they're talking. 

[[Umbert Silvernail\|Umbert Silvernail]] (the man who runs the general store) introduces himself to us. 

Ulfgar gives a speech, Berrain raises a glass and said "To ulfgar and the brawny awl!"

Berrain seems a bit more humble, and a bit more locked into the vibes around him.
