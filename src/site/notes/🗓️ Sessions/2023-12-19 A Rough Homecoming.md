## Brawny Awl
- We make it
- The defensive walls seem almost done
- Wilhelm is set up and a few other stalls look happening
- The tavern also seems mostly complete
- A while back the party
	- guards
	- construction workers
	- a few visitors
		- A werebear dwarf that the crew had met on islecross
		- A few people seem to be stopping by temporarily
- There are a few tents pitched in the caravansary
- Some vines of corruption coming in encroaching about a mile or so out from the Brawny Awl
- Crash then silence from the tavern
	- In the tavern: mostly guards, construction workers, only a few travelers
	- Big head guard guy has ale on him
	- Wood elf picking up the glass
		- Bria in the back
		- I slip in the back
			- I hear a soft crying
			- We chat
				- bad guard grabbed her hard after she spilled
- We sit at a table
	- Ulfgar runs out to the watchtower to meditate
	- O Aust and I have a chat about capitalism and democracy
		- O is surprisingly pro capitalism
- [[ðŸ™‹ People/Gotrick Ironbranch\|Gotrick Ironbranch]]
