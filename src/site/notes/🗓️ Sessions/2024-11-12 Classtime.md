### Aust Meditating
Doing a ritual in an empty but renovated room in the keep
Setting up some crystals and stuff in the room to get in the mindset

Aust is in the fighting pit and meets another new person who is one of the spirit guardians.

"The line does end with you, you know that right" - Aust's creepy spirit guardian
Sorantir

Soryntyrr (she/her) shoots a crossbow and starts to fight Aust.
	Drow Spirit Guardian of Aust, died millennia ago
She is a bit of a dick and goading, and then Aust rolls a nat 20 which ends thing.

"Go Home, kill your mom, and make changes and retrieved the ancestral rite
	"We've all been through it. "
Innumable spirit guardians of different races.
	"You are much more powerful than any petty follower of lolth"

Aust has a vission 
	Seeing darkness and within the darkness a light
	And life in the light (singular? essence? hard to say)
	The light splits. first into two then many parts
	One piece lands on the ground. Growing dimmer. Now more definable as a soft grey glow. 
	A shape, almost spherical. Many sided pentagonal shape. Can't get a sense for how large.
		This is what you seek
		Your mission? You yourself feel driven to it.

Aust awakens having seen this object and feeling the connection. It feels like a bird being called to migrate. He has an innate sense of where to go, a need to head eastward.
