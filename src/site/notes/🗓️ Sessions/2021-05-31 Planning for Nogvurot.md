2 day trip through quenna gap
Aust practices fighting with lyra

## Planning
Last City on the glory run road, until the capital
large military outpost
Aegis block = military presence. All things to do with arming the military
[[🤝 Factions/Righteous Brand\|Righteous Brand]] is the dwendalian military

Military presence has been increasing and increasing
Smallhorn = ritzy suburbs
	This is where Renkorr lives
	At this point has probably moved to Starosta Manor
Old starosta is dead
Renkorr is Interim starosta as far as we know
She tried to get to manor but was told to leave by aegis block

Starosta Manor in Aegis block
Council of six are right under starosta 
Renkorr was the coinmaster

Last mission was going to the warmaster, the person in charge of righteous brand

Previously, the last Aegis just existed in their block
Crownsguard were the old policing force
	Crownsguard is gone now

When asked about it, told to watch questions and keep mouth shut

Group of mercenaries from over seas “replacing” the crowns guard but Lyra didn’t see them while in town.

All crownsguard friends are gone. Less people out on the streets. Market place is bone dry

What happened to the crownsguard?
Why is everyone in town so weird?
What the hell is going on with Allistair Renkorr?

Lyra’s contact
met last time
could get in with old watchmaster perhaps (not on the council but could be there)

### Marissa, lyra’s Mom ([[🙋 People/Marissa Thokk\|Marissa Thokk]] and [[🙋 People/Arnold Paslin\|Arnold Paslin]])

Marissa changed after Lyra’s dad died

17 years ago her dad got sick with a disease. Slowly started forgetting things, then stopped functioning altogether. Catatonic. Lyra was 13

Arnold Paslin, Lyra's dad. Author. Average human man. Sweet kind face.

book itself seems to be pulp fiction, fantasy fiction

O is uncomfortable about this disease
Lyra and her mom used to smashing things and fixing it

Katherine / O has a disease where they forget things, they have a secret thing to hold the illness at bay. Only Aust knows.

Pearl bow (forest to the west of here) Marissa is lion of the Pearl bow

Righteous brand acting as TSA almost for getting into the city. Chain mail and shields, spears, and helmets. 

Passports implemented a few months previously. Now licensed weapons in the city (can go to embassy for passport and weapon licensing 

Name, place of residence, business in town, length of stay, unlicensed weapons?

Aust = Atala Argith

O = Phillip Organson

Ulfgar = Mud Raventhral

Curfew Sundown

Gave them my shortsword, but have 3 daggers hiding in my boots/ small of back
Made it into the city after going through TSA
Old Starosta Brumae Lude
was general of righteous brand
was pretty old, but wasn’t on death’s door before hand.

Watchmaster was in charge ofcrowns guard, crownsguard are now missing.

warmaster was in charge of righteous brand

righteous brand are now police force

Lyra is getting in touch with “friend” who can get us in touch with old watchmaster
