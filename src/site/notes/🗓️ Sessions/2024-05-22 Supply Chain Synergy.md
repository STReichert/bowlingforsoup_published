We hear from [[ü§ù Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the Diarchy]]:
	No [[üôã People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] :(
	We can try to convince people in the Brawny awl and they will allow that but not commanded
	As far as supplies go
		We are given a small receipt we are told to bring to the quartermaster up by the gates of Uthodurn

We go to the Quartermaster (Daisy Bottlebeard)
	Something like a bank teller in a storeroom
	We meet Daisy, a middle aged dwarven woman who runs the storeroom
		We meet her and she is sort of running the storeroom
	She puts together a crate of potions and such with some great goods
	She gets some help from a guard on duty on patrol
		There is usually whoever is on shift 
		There is some guard middle management who assigns everyone's posts
			Mack Lucas up in the guard tower
	The next shipment went out a week ago, it takes about 2 weeks or so
	Scuttlebut about town that there are drugs going around the upper rings of Uthodurn
We check out the loading/unloading area out front to see what's up. There is currently a guard named Derek there right now.
	There is a cart that is pulled up the dock with a bunch of barrels on it
		Derek: a built elf loading and unloading some fish from palebank village
		Derek tuesdays and thursdays are his scheduled days
	Near the bottom of the barrels there is some uniform wear and tear were a false bottom might go.

A standard guard is pretty squishy (11 hit points), but Stonebrow is definitely heartier. We don't feel great about bringing them along. We need to have some amount of familiarity with you are going.

We set up our inventories and magic items.
We agree to go tomorrow morning

As we sleep, the representative from the Krin Dynasty ways on Aust. There is a dreem, but not a new dream persay. The last full astral meditation

Ulfgar has a dream: he recalls a day many years ago waking to the sound of alarm bells. Horrible omen of undead moose? but in the past it was an elk. This moose is the present day. It just walks into the courtyard.
