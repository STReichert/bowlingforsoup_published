Going to meet [[🤝 Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the Diarchy]]
- The Krin dynasty group is in there before us. One of them clocks Aust a bit and says "light be with you"
- We try to tell them about the Haggs and they ask some additional questions about how we know about them.
- The previous arcanist went looking for artifacts from Aeor on Islecross and never returned. The team had maybe heard a few stories about him but not much.
