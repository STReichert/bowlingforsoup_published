We fight the effigy of the people that fell in the pit (lyra, aust, mug, heckud, ulfgar)
Vines controlling them
elven women screaming but then dissapeared.
we are gonna try to take a piece of the vines in a glass vial
vines with pulsating energy
fae and infernal
Vines at blooming grove not pulsating but similar
We find some creepy blood capsules in the heart of the effigys butÂ 

On the edge of the circle notice a smalish footprint, not shoed, with marks in the ground with claws/very long toenails, very similar to what found by the pit.

Make a sketch of this footprint
