## Previous Session Recap
O, Faem, and Ulfgar have soup around the fire and O decides to return.
Aust had a moment with Yarrowish and learned that they are soul linked at the moment and can't just break the bond.
## Agenda/To-Do
[[🕵️‍♀️ Mysteries and Quests ⚔️/Taking Down Stonebrow\|Taking Down Stonebrow]]
[[🕵️‍♀️ Mysteries and Quests ⚔️/Aust's Family and the Underdark\|Aust's Family and the Underdark]]

## Summary
> I think it is a good sign that you feel ethically troubled by this - O about Aust

Aust thinks it is the time to go to the underdark
	The dreams have continued and this may be the next logical step. 
	Aust needs a week or so to get this meditation going 

Ulfgar wants to hold a brunch and O wants to do some restorative justice on stonebrow.
- Aust doesn't love the restorative justice idea but Ulfgar and Faem are on board with starting with a brunch to start building a community
Aust and O have a conversation after Ulfgar goes off berry picking
	Aust is worried about O leaving and is worried that they are not comfortable about going into a world where violence is the rule of law
	And is worried of what O might see in him in the underdark.

When O walked away perhaps they betrayed one of their bigger values: this group and how much we all care about eachother.
	Where we are going is full of ethical conflict for O. 
	They had thought they needed to walk away to avoid the conflict. 
	But in returning they are realizing that what is the point of the morals unless you are using them and engaging in the messiness. The messiness is where the richness lies.
	This is where they intend to be

Aust was worried O came back because of pressure. 
	Aust is worried about us all coming to the underdark.
		O- there is this part of you that worries, perhaps, that if we follow you to the underdark that we might change our opinion of you. 
		There is a deep goodness to you, which shines more because of what it has had to go through to be there. 
		I hope one day you can see that, and even if you can't, that you can see in our choices to be with you.
	Aust - \[sobbing]  "I'm going to go meditate now"

### Ulfgar is picking berries
The berries are out, Ulfgar cast plant growth. They are going strong.
Ulfgar meets a boar that started charging him in the woods and from up in the trees hears a voice say "Hi-ho! thank you for distracting that foul beast for me"
	Dark brownskinned elf (tree bark colored) Oak.

[[🙋 People/Elsavara Roarin\|Elsavara Roarin]] - Hunter Extraordinare
	"Panini" is probably my favorite character around
	[[🙋 People/Gotrick Ironbranch\|Gotrick Ironbranch]] Is great to talk to.
	Stonebrow is a straightforward man, not a great person to hang out with and they buy his boar.
	Money is not necessarily the end goal. 
	He hopes to stay in the awl for a while
	He would be open to helping Ulfgar get some meat and supplies for Jerky making. 
		He did hunt down a displacer beast a bit ago and has some meat to share for jerky making.
We could get ahold of 3-4 boars at 5 gold a piece 

### Faem walking the Awl
noticed the storefronts have started to become inhabited beyond Wilhelm's 
	 Above one there are these market doors. Some metal swords crossed over a shield
		 some arms dealer
	 The silver nail general store
	 The end of the row, there isn't much too it other than an intricate wood handle carved in the shape of a lions head
		 an older women is coming out and locking it. 
		 [[🙋 People/Poninny\|Poninny]]
			 makes decorative wood carvings
			 hardwear.
			 Creatures
			 trees
			 Odd objects
			 Gods houses.
		Goes back behind the keep
			the Herby-derbies 
			She maybe had her family stab her in the back
			She lived on the streets before?
		From time to time people come to buy small tokens
			She doesn't go out too often at night.
			Gotrick is quite a dear
### O walking Uthodurn
Stumbles on a class about speaking giants. This teacher on the poster looks like a Goliath.
	Not quite a snake-oil salesman vibe. 
	A week long class about speaking giant and giant culture. This person has rented out an event space on the Libre disk for the immersive language and culture course.
The poster was slimming him down.
	He is very tall, muscular, and has a little pot belly.
He seems wild. 
O has been reading 
	*My Neighbor Rolgerf* a book that seems fanciful and exoticized. 
The class size is about 7 others or so. 
	O wants to sponsor an extra spot in the course
		Under the "Ruby Memorial Scholarship" anonymously.
		A full schollarship. Merit based. Don't know how to evaluate that necessarily. Maybe need based?
			It might be especially wonderful if there is a young person who needs the funds and has a lot of interest i
	First class meets tomorrow. As part of the experience, there will be an outdoor excursion out onto the mountain if you will be up for the exertion.
		Tomorrow evening to start the class.
