## Previous Session Recap
Meet Ruby in the caverns under the hut. and, surprise, she wants to die. She is a hag but hasn't become a hag yet. 
We resurrect [[🙋 People/PCs/Aust\|Aust]] with [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] and with [[🙋 People/Siobhan Byrch\|Siobhan]]

We also un-stoned [[🙋 People/Siobhan Byrch\|Siobhan]] and took all of the hostages, including [[🙋 People/Ruby (of Power)\|Ruby (of Power)]] back to the [[🗺️ Places/Blooming Grove\|Blooming Grove]]. 

Ulfgar, Faem, and Zahara all help try to bring Aust back. Meanwhile Aust has visions of the fighting ring with his ancesters being like "it isn't your time." 
## Agenda/To-Do
- Unpack Aust's resurrection with O
- Figure out what we will do with Ruby.
## Summary
We have a long debrief with Aust in Zahara's study. 
	Zahara is going to talk to [[King Imathen\|King Imathen]] a bit about the arm of Bane 
While Aust is being resurrected O is restlessly walking around the Blooming Grove
	They have a conversation with Mug. [[🙋 People/Mug\|Mug]] wants to help out O, but O just needs to move I think. 
When Aust, Ulfgar, and Faem get back to the blooming grove Mug offers us some ale and Aust and O have a long conversation about their differences and how each is feeling about the resurrection. 
	O "Things have to mean things" death has to mean something. 
	O is happy that Aust is here but feels almost shameful of feeling happy, and like a heretic. 
	O doesn't feel like they're values are... well... valued. 
	O set out on their journey to find out why evil exists in this world and to understand people. And has learned that not everyone holds the sanctity of life in the same way, and some are good and some are bad. 
		O maybe doesn't want to compromise 
	Aust wanted to come back. Aust's life means something to him. 
		"I've envied the clarity with which you seem to know what is right and what is wrong"

> Love, perhaps, is the only perfect circle.
   \- Olo

Aust thinks, O maybe just needs some time. 

## Going sOlo
Savalier is "Guilt" translated. Walking through the wood, it has a different quality to it. Fireflies start to light up the wood and there is a warmth to the air. 

O starts walking to the Dunrock mountains towards the Menagerie coast, having decided not to kill Ruby. 

While drinking with Faem, Ulfgar, and Aust, Ruby comes down the stairs and Aust feels compelled by the sword to kill Ruby and one hit kills her.

## For Next Time
- [ ] Lift the curse on Aust from this sword (Aust goes to Zahara for help)
- [x] Faem and Ulfgar go try to catch up with O and get them to come back.

## Talking about O
They want to make their way to the menagerie coast at some point but they don't want to retire their character necessarily.
