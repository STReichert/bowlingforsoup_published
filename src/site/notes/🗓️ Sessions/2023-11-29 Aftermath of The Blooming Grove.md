## Recap
- We fought off a bunch of yeth hounds from the [[🗺️ Places/Blooming Grove\|Blooming Grove]]
- Aurelia was actually a hag who petrified [[Siobhan\|Siobhan]]
	- She is definitively petrified (turned to stone)
	- It is possible to restore someone who has been petrified (greater restoration)
		- but a rune on her forehead that was the rune on the talisman the hag had

We are at [[🗺️ Places/Blooming Grove\|Blooming Grove]] and after the sunshard transference completed it seems almost like daylight.

The Yeth hounds just turn into mist in this light.

The hag was not destroyed but she was repelled (her skin began to burn and she flew off to the north)

Tree ent roots and becomes dormant possibly?
## Session
[[Caducious Clay\|Caducious Clay]] is upset because the Hag was playing us all pretending to be his mom.

> [[🙋 People/PCs/Ulfgar Brawnanvile\|Ulfgar Brawnanvile]]: "Flesh made stone can be made flesh again"

[[🙋 People/PCs/O\|O]] is thinking about the runes and knows that it is an esoteric magic and that Wilhelm deals in runes. (the [[🗺️ Places/Brawny Awl\|Brawny Awl]] is a week long trip from the blooming grove)

[[🙋 People/PCs/Aust\|Aust]] tells Caducious to go chop some wood with some strong exclamations. 

We sent Wilhelm a picture of the rune asking about it.

Ulfgar checks out the crops, and while dead, they are alive in there somewhere.
- Light seems to be radiating for like a full mile. 
- Tree ent is in a dormant state healing and hibernating maybe?
	- A tree ent just wouldn't storm a temple of melora/eldath normally

Jade says that Heidi Hobleham thought that the blooming grove was a thorn in the side of the Hag coven.
- She said that the time for the blooming grove was very short
- Restoring it could put the hag coven on their heels

The corruption has been around since 585 BD, or about 250 years ago (it is 835 BD). About 100 years ago the combined efforts of [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] and Ulfalo, that was when the Brawny Awl was attacked in correlation to those efforts.

[[The Morning Star\|The Morning Star]] had existed as a hilt with swirling light
- The magic does not seem entirely gone from this, the sun shard had been fused into Baskabad's weapon. The weapon is still maybe a bit magical in the generic hilt. 

Heidi did inform us that there was a coven in the depths of the Savelier wood, believes they may be more likely to be centered in a swampy area.

Ruins of Molaesmyr were where the corruption was first recorded/observed

O has a moment with Caducious who has been splitting wood.
- He is obviously pretty darn upset and agitated
- Caducious is balling.
	- Low mornful sound that echos through the area
	- He begins to regulate a bit

They have a deep and sad moment. 
- O quotes frozen II: "The next right thing to do" when it is dark.
- Caducious wants to run into the woods and plunge a sword into the heart of whoever the hell has been doing this
	- But he's tired, and he knows he is best at tending the plots.
	- Can O promise that these bastards will be put down.
- Caducious goes to lay in the light
- O says "may you always be in the light"
