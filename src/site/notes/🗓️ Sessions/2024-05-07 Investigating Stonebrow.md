We enter the tavern to meet Berrain Stonebrown with some guards
- As we enter Stonebrow is pretending to not notice us
	- he has been importing smank
		- addictive stimulant, consumed as like a waxy caramel thing
		- It doesn't seem like people are super up on smank, 
		- he has mostly been moving it to uthodurn in the empty barrels 
	- every few weeks theres a caravan back and forth
		- quartermaster for the guard (Daisy Bottlebeard)
		- When I was with Shaz I woulda heard the name stonebrow but probably not in detail
	- He would love more money, but also some more consistent shipments.
	- He's a fairly good bullshitter. We wouldn't be able to get an easy read on him.  But his family might be a little aware... hard to say.
- Derald Information
	- The empty barrels were stored in the underground passage area. And he would put the supplies in them.

Aust and [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] have dinner and gossip
- Aust tells [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] maybe too much about the Major and that we hired a drug smuggling child as our accountant
- Someone from the Krin dynasty is coming to talk with [[🤝 Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the diarchy]] about the war in the south
- We have a meeting with [[🤝 Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the diarchy]] tomorrow but [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] is probably not going to be able to join the meeting or to come with us to the woods.

For next time
- Plan how to get through to stonebrow
- Shipment should be arriving to the Brawny awl in 2-3 days 
	- [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] has said that with the hag beeing in the brawny awl last night we should move pretty quick
- Plan how to make the sell to [[🤝 Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the Diarchy]] to get [[🙋 People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] to come with us
	- Anything else we want to say to [[🤝 Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the Diarchy]]
		- They are less wrapped up in the politicking so we could maybe talk to them about the guard situation.
- Anything we want to do in Uthodurn
