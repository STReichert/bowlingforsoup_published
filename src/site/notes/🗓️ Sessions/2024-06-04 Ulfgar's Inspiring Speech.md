We all wake up in the morning to alarm bells as there is the decaying moose sent to be a bad omen for the Brawny awl

Seems to have been gutted and have had an eye gouged out.

There is commotion, guards come from the defensive walls and tavern, people shouting and pointing spears and such.

Ulfgar is in shock and just in his room
	O is helping Ulfgar trying to do some crisis control
		The same thing is not happening again

The tavern keepers are looking on worriedly and there is a crowd around this moose.
	O walks through the crowd to give a prayer to the moose?
Ulfgar and I notice that
	Moose aren't found in these parts very often
	This is the moose that we had met at Heddy Hobleham
	We notice a piece of parchment and I slight of hand

We should make an announcement 
	Give people a few days, we are trying to take care of it
	If we don't come back, they should evacuate 
The parchment proposes a trade
	"an eye for a friend"
We talk to Ulfgar as he tries to run into the secret passages
	We try to make sure that we can convey his confidence 
Ulfgar get's up to talk 
	He tells the whole story but puts a huge confident spin on it.
	"We come back with the head of a hag"
	Berrain gives a nod at Ulfgar after the speech with a little respect
Wilhelm is open to nullifying the talismen that is holding Siobhan
	Also will be able to teleport those who can't travel. ie [[ðŸ™‹ People/Derald\|Derald]]
We go up to the arcanist's tower to teleport
	[[ðŸ™‹ People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] is there getting ready to scry and help us teleport
	If we use the eye, we can scry easier, but it would probably be ok if we don't
	Teleportation
		Mixed chances of success
		With the eye, we add +10 to the roll (bonus chance)
Scrying:
	We are going to use the eye
		We see an image in crystal ball...
			We see a familiar figure. The hag that impersonated Aurelia Clay and [[Zahara\|Zahara]] In her full form. She has an intense hunch in her back, a pointed chin and sharp teeth. Tattered ragged clothes. 
			She is sitting in a dark twisted wood hunched over a Cauldron over a fire.
			The hag is hunched over a Cauldron, brewing something within. She reaches down and grabs a long length of intestines. As she walks towards the hut
			She calls for Gertrude who is "Playing with the livestock"
				blue 
				The first one is Millicent (a green one?)
			In the hut/room there are a number
				"Annabel's sneaking has left us with a limited supply"
			Gertrude, the blue eyes
				She doesn't have any eyes in her face
			There is a body bound to the wall in the hag's cottage
				[[ðŸ™‹ People/Aurelia Clay\|Aurelia Clay]] has been tortured for a long time it looks like.
			Once they've taken care of their business
				"Annabel is pruning the garden"
				They said they would be coming in "a week's time"
