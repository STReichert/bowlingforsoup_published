## Where we are:

- [[üôã People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] is talking to [[ü§ù Factions/Diarchy of Uthodurn\|the diarchy]] to ask them to let [[üôã People/Zahara Norixius\|Zahara]] go with us
- she is also looking into opitons for scrying on the Hags
- Ulfgar is interested in looking for an apothecary kit
- O is maybe gonna talk to grand arbor pentera
- Aust and Faem are gonna investigate the Captain
## O looking for Grand Arbor Pentera

- O finds him in a beautiful church, in the tree in the center (O climbs up)
- O presents the mace as the thing that brings them to the grand Arbor
- O tells the story
- Followers of Eldath: Sanctity of life... and death... and the cycle that connects them.
- Village under attack by the undead
- Sioban, the one who's mace this is, betrayed O and their religious beliefs
- "What makes this weapon so important to weild?"
- Sioban made O promise
- Sioban thinks it was a gift from Eldath as a vestige of the divergence. But this is controversial among followers of Eldath.
- She wants it to go to someone she trusts and who doesn't want to use it.
- O saw her kill the necromancer. It frightened them.
- the lack of hesitaiton...
- A part of O is resentful that she would even ask
	- "Are you unsure about the Mace or about yourself?"
	- Both
	- a lot rests on O's moral judgement.
- "By whose measure do you judge yourself? Eldath? Your companions?"
- Yes? O's Parents "I don't Know"
- "Many people with such questions turn to their faith, but the god's don't walk among us, and we can't know what they would do or say" We gotta follow ourselves.
- Arbor: tempted to think that the Gods are as close to the ideas of morals as can be.
- If you were Eldath, what would your beleifs be? Are you following or are you leading in your own light?
## The investigators (Aust and Faem)
- We go find Gotrick!
- Room that is extremely cluttered
- Gotrick is behind stacks and stacks of stuff

- Protection in town...
- Employment of people to take care of the keep
- Guards: [[üôã People/Berrain Stonebrow\|Berrain Stonebrow]]

- His uncle is the head of defense of uthodur
- He seems to be enjoying himself...
- Gotrick has tried to talk to him but it doesn't go very well
- Gotrick isn't sure

- Shares jerky...
- Wilhelm: "like gum ... but made of meat..."
- Ulfgar does a pairing of jerky _AND_ pickles and wilhelm starts to get it!
- Wilhelm recommends a bag of colding (500 gold)
- Wilhelm offers Ulfgar a deal (200 gold) for the bag of colding for us fixing the forest and stuff
- Maybe Ulfgar selling jerky out of his shop?
## O Attuning to the Mace
- O fails the first time
- But O thinks about a good memory with Sioban (a playful moment doing dishes and splashing eachother
- O feels another presence, something solid there with them.

## Faem and Aust pretend to party with cops

- He spots Aust as beeing a bit sus
- But he doesn't know much about where to find stonebrow
- We go to the tavern but he isn't there
- I sneak into his room but roll a very bad investigation check
- I steal some papers from the desk that don't seem like they'll stir susspicion
- But someone (Stonebrow) is coming up the stairs
- I sneak out but don't lock the door (oops)
- Stonebrow comes up and Aust explains Sasha as a his/their part time assistant.
- Aust agrees to come back with Ulfgar and Rav at 6:30 to meet up with him at the tavern.
- He goes to unlock the door and finds it unlocked as we get the hell out of there... (yikes)
