Aust had a dream about his mother taking a sun shard. He recieved instructions from spirit guides saying that to fully recieve mysteries he would need to go back to the [[üó∫Ô∏è Places/Underdark\|Underdark]]. Family probably has something to do with it.

## Aust's Family
His mother was a high priestess of Lolth (the betrayer god the spider queen). For the most part having lots of children is common, but he was the only next of kin (and was a bit special because of it). He was forced to fight from a young age (there is a lot of ritualized violence). When completing his final right of passage, he was asked to kill a male slave by his mentor, but Aust killed the mentor and then he had to run away.

Aust has a talisman so that he can't be found by them, but he was once a chosen one.

Aust has been having a bunch of visions lately. 
	Vision of Aust being in a cart and the cart being attacked by his mother and some guards. And they managed to take away a beacon of light and the male slave Aust spared. 
	Aust needs to go reclaim this light (maybe something sunshard-y)
