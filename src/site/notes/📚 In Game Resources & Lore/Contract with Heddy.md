1. The parties of Olo, Ulfgar, Aust, and Faem will be teleported to a cleric capable of casting Greater Restoration who may restore the lost life of Faem of the Silver Raven Clan
2. In exchange, one Olo will destroy the Ruby of Power.
	1. In the event that the Ruby of Power is not destroyed by the undersigned parties, it must be delivered immediately by hand to Heddy Hobbleham who shall ensure it is kept safe from use by any individual or group, Heddy included, until means of its destruction can be acquired. 
3. The destruction of the Ruby of power will incur no physical or magical ill effects on any plane of existence or habitants thereof. 
4. Aust gets to have possession of the cool obsidian sword from the bottom of the acid lake with the fancy writing, you know the one i mean B) 
5. Information about Grimlone (“the worm”), to the full extent of your knowledge 
6. The moose is transported SAFELY outside of the walls to the brawny awl, at once, on the ground, not dropped from the sky 
7. Any knowledge that you have about the whereabouts of Faem’s family/clan
8. Information regarding preparation for confronting the coven 
9. IF Olo should come to understand that the destruction of the Ruby goes against the major tenets of Eldath they have the option to NOT destroy the ruby 
	1. If so, Olo shall sacrifice 26 years of their life (making them age to 46, leaving them 4 years til the end of their natural life cycle). 
	2. This clause allows 1. You get the Ruby destroyed if what you say about its benefits are as purported 2. Gives me an out that is costly, so I do not use it unless absolutely necessary (note that the taking of life or bargained aging would be very blasphemous to me as an Eldath priest) 
	3. If Olo does not destroy, Faem’s reversal remains as is (they stay healed), it is only O who will be aged as punishment
