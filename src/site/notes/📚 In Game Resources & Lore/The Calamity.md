Evil Gods, brought the nine hells and abyss to this world. Gods such as Melora fought Temodius, Bane and other betrayer gods. Certain champions were selected by the gods and selected to fight in these wars. Ulfgar’s armor is one of the pieces from these champions. Pentath, chosen champion of Melora, given the hide of the feral guardian. Maybe given by chance, maybe divine right? 

Eventually the divergence, where all gods, betrayer and good gods, were pushed behind the divine gate. a barrier between the realms.

Arms of the betrayers, things gifted by the betrayers to their “champions” vestiges, artifacts. Used for wrongdoing.
