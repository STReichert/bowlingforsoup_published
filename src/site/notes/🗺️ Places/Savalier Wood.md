The woods that stand between [[🗺️ Places/Shady Creek Run\|Shady Creek Run]] and [[🗺️ Places/Uthodurn\|Uthodurn]] that have been devastated by [[🕵️‍♀️ Mysteries and Quests ⚔️/The Corruption\|The Corruption]]. The deeper into the woods one ventures the more dangerous they are... There are all manner of nasty monsters and trees seem to be corrupted by strange vines.
