## Background
Raised in the Silent Raven Clan (~18 people) in the village of Kend near the city of Nogvurot. Faem’s family were primarily farmers making a simple life in a village of around 200 people. As a child, Faem’s proclivity for roguish activities was recognized by their Uncle Sairs, who had returned to the clan not long before Faem was born. Faem was unsure of what their uncle did before returning to the clan, but he was able to teach Faem how to use their skills effectively as a changeling rogue. 

As a restless young adult, Faem traveled to the city of Nogvurot to put their skills to the test under the alias of Merrian Liarie, a half elf. While running a grift at a high society party, Faem was caught by [[🙋 People/Lord Alastair Renkorr\|Lord Alastair Renkorr]], Minister of Trade for [[🗺️ Places/Nogvurot\|Nogvurot]], and his personal bodyguard Lyra Thokk. Lord Renkorr offered his silence on the matter and training in the intricacies of high society in exchange for Faem’s talents being put to work for his purposes. While working for Lord Renkorr, Faem formed a strong relationship with Lyra providing a chaotic yin to Lyra’s lawful yang. During this time the Lord was granted the title of Baron and promoted to Coinmaster for Nogvurot. 

Eventually, Faem revealed to Lyra that they were a changeling and was told that they had to tell the Baron or Lyra would do it herself. Upon revealing to Baron Renkorr that they were a changeling, the Baron gave Faem the task of taking the visage of the recently deceased husband of Baroness Oltria Stem, Warmaster for Nogvurot, and placing the blame for his own death on a member of the Crownsguard. Baron Renkorr told Faem one of his spies in the Crownsguard heard another Crownguard talking about killing the Baroness’s husband and saw fellow members helping cover up the truth. Only another Baron/Baroness of the city could declare an investigation into the corruption, but Baron Renkorr could not do so without exposing his spy. 

Appearing in front of Baroness Stem, Faem saw the woman break down and immediately regretted agreeing to this plan. After delivering the message and disappearing, leaving the Baroness sobbing, Faem was caught in the alley by a man who showed them the token of the Subtle Paw clan (the clan of changelings in Nogvurot) and berated them for breaking the Code. After being told by this individual to leave the city, lest Faem be punished by the Subtle Paw, Faem said a quick goodbye to Lyra and confronted Baron Renkorr. 

Over the next few years Faem ran to escape Lyra, who relentlessly pursued her. Eventually Faem found a brief respite for just over a year in Shadycreek Run working for the Trebains until Lyra showed up in the north by surprise having tracked Faem down in [[🗺️ Places/Palebank Village\|Palebank Village]].
